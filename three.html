        <h1>Assassin's Creed III</h1>

    <section class="bred">

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>

        <p>Assassin's Creed III is a third-person action-adventure title set in an open world in which the player uses a combination of stealth, 
           parkour, and combat to complete various missions. The player takes the role of three characters during the course of the game. 
           The main character is Desmond Miles, a 21st-century Assassin, working to uncover the secrets of a mysterious Precursor Vault that will 
           protect the Earth from an upcoming solar flare on December 21, 2012. To uncover the secrets, Desmond uses the Animus to live out memories of 
           two of his ancestors which the player controls during these sequences, both set at the time of the American Revolutionary War. 
           The first, briefly played at the start of the game, is Haytham Kenway, a British Templar who seeks the location of the Vault. 
           The second, and the primary character for the game, is Ratonhnhaké:ton, the result of a brief liaison between Kenway and a Native American woman.
           Ratonhnhaké:ton takes on the name Connor to blend in better with colonial society. When playing as Connor, 
           the player has access to a huge wilderness known as the Frontier (which is 1.5 times bigger than Rome in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood), 
           the cities of Boston and New York City. Portions of the Eastern Seaboard and Caribbean Sea can be explored via the flagship of the 
           Assassin's navy, the Aquila, captained by Connor Kenway himself, with Robert Faulkner his first-mate advising and teaching him in the ways 
           of the sea.</p>

        <p>Free running has been simplified to allow for more fluid parkour in the cities and wilderness, such as climbing and running on trees, 
           mountains, cliffs, etc. Close combat has been modified, allowing Connor to dual-wield weapons and take down multiple opponents at once and 
           players no longer need to manage the lock-on mechanic. Aiding this, Connor has access to a wide range of weapons which include muskets, 
           swords, pistols, native weapons such as the tomahawk and bow and arrow, a rope dart (used to pull foes or hang them, while on a tree) 
           as well as the Hidden Blades. In addition, the left Hidden Blade has a folding mechanism for blocking attacks, skinning an animal, 
           and performing high-profile assassinations. Human shields can be used against firing lines of enemies. 
           Medicine is no longer used as health recovers automatically. Stealth is also revamped, allowing players to use natural elements such as 
           tall grass and trees to hide, along with the ability to blend between any two people.</p>

        <p>Assassin's Creed III features new weather simulations such as snow, fog, and rain. The seasons can also change i.e., 
           Summer and Winter, which not only affect visuals but also gameplay, as the player will find that they run slower in deep snow. 
           Snowfall can reduce visibility for the player and enemies, aiding stealth. Unlike the past games, this one includes animals varying from 
           domestic (horses, cows, dogs) to wild (deer, wolves, bears). The wild ones are found in the Frontier, and can be hunted for meat or marrow in 
           order to be sold. The quality of the kill determines the price, encouraging the player to hunt silently. For this, traps and bait can also 
           be used.</p>

        <p>Economy is now based on the Davenport Homestead, which also acts as Connor's adoptive home. 
           The site can be visited by people such as carpenters, tailors etc. suffering from displacement due to the war. 
           Helping and interacting with these non-player characters (NPCs) will encourage them to settle in the Homestead. 
           From there on, the player can craft various items and trade with them, and then sell the goods to the cities via caravan. 
           The player can also help them build relationships with each other, which will then result in the formation of a small village. 
           The player can also upgrade the Homestead manor as well as Connor's ship, the Aquila.</p>

        <p>A revamped version of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood's recruitment feature returns as players can enlist citizens to the Assassin's cause by 
           completing "Liberation" missions. They also have a much larger skill set, which allows them to start a riot, provide a covert escort, 
           act as a personal bodyguard etc. Other side missions include collecting Almanac pages, exploring underground tunnels to locate fast-travel 
           stations, joining hunting and fighting clubs, investigating frontiersman rumors about UFOs and Sasquatch, "peg-leg" missions in which Connor 
           goes to underground forts and wastelands to uncover the legend of Captain Kidd's treasure, and others.</p>

        <p>Assassin's Creed III also features naval expeditions. Using Connor's warship, the Aquila, the player can navigate the high seas. 
           Control of the ship relies on environmental factors such as wind direction and speed, local presence of storms, high waves, and rocks. 
           Engagements are by cannon, with broadsides covering both flanks of the ship, swivel guns that can be used to damage smaller ships which can 
           also be boarded to find treasure, and chain shots from the broadsides as well to take down the masts of larger ships and disable them. 
           The Aquila is used in the side missions known as "Privateer missions" and is also used in some of the main missions.</p>

        <p>The Wii U version of the game has extra features. The player has the ability to change weapons on the go and the map is always visible on the 
           Wii U Gamepad. The Wii U version also supports Off TV Play. With this feature enabled, the main screen is redirected to the Wii U Gamepad.</p>

        <p>Online multiplayer returns in this installment by Ubisoft Annecy. Along with returning modes, new ones feature a co-operative mode named 
           Wolfpack, in which 1–4 players are charged with killing certain NPCs within a time limit, through a sequence of 25 stages. 
           It also features Domination, a team mode where players will have to capture certain areas of the map, protecting them from the opposing team.</p>

        <h1>Synopsis</h1>

    <section class="bred">

        <h2>Setting</h2>
    
        <p>Following the events of Assassin's Creed: Revelations, the game explores the life of an 18th-century assassin in Colonial America during the 
           American Revolution; a half-English, half-Mohawk man named Ratonhnhaké:ton, also known as Connor, whose father is Grand Master of the Templar 
           Order in the colonies. Connor is caught up in the Assassins' conflict with the Templar order when his Native American village is attacked by 
           the Templars, who intend to seize control of the newly forming country.</p>

        <p>Connor's story spans through two decades of his life. From his childhood in 1760 to 1783. Boston and New York City are cities that can be 
           explored, as well as the American Colonial Frontier, spanning forest, cliffs, rivers, Connor's Mohawk village, and the settlements of Lexington,
           and Concord. The player can hunt small and large animals, and approximately one third of the story takes place in the Frontier. 
           The city of Philadelphia can also be visited at one point during the game, as can The Caribbean during several naval missions. 
           The entire Eastern seaboard is also explorable via Connor's captaining his naval warship, the Aquila.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>

        <p>Assassin's Creed III features a large cast of characters. The main character is Ratonhnhaké:ton (Noah Watts), also known as Connor, 
           an 18th-century assassin.</p>

        <p>The 18th century characters include Achilles Davenport (Roger Aaron Brown), Connor's mentor and a retired assassin; Connor's mother Kaniehtí:io 
           or Ziio (Kaniehtiio Horn); Connor's first mate aboard the Aquila Robert Faulkner (Kevin McNally); and the French taverner Stephane Chapheau 
           (Shawn Baichoo). The Colonial Templars are led by Connor's father, the English nobleman Haytham Kenway (Adrian Hough). 
           He is aided by several historical figures who are portrayed as members of the Templar order including Charles Lee (Neil Napier), 
           Thomas Hickey (Allen Leech), John Pitcairn (Robert Lawrenson), Benjamin Church (Harry Standjofski), William Johnson (Julian Casey), 
           and Nicholas Biddle. The era also features several other historical figures such as Israel Putnam (Andreas Apergis), George Washington 
           (Robin Atkin Downes), Thomas Jefferson (John Emmet Tracy), Mason Weems (Tod Fennell), Paul Revere (Bruce Dinsmore), Edward Braddock, 
           Benjamin Franklin (Rick Jones), and Samuel Adams (Mark Lindsay Chapman).</p>
    
        <p>Other characters include Minerva (Margaret Easley) and Juno (Nadia Verrucci), members of Those Who Came Before; and the Grand Master of the 18th 
           century Templar Order in England, Reginald Birch (Gideon Emery).</p>

        <h2>Plot</h2>

        <p>Immediately after the events of the previous game, assassin Desmond Miles, his father William, with allies Rebecca Crane and Shaun Hastings 
           find the Temple of the First Civilization in a cave in New York and access it using their Apple of Eden, an ancient artifact of immense power. 
           After partially activating the temple, Juno uses it to communicate with Desmond. Desmond is placed in the Animus where Juno's influence causes 
           him to experience the life of his ancestor in 1754 England: the Templar Grand Master, Haytham Kenway.</p>

        <p>Haytham assassinates a patron at the Royal Opera House and steals a medallion; the Key to the Temple's inner chamber. 
           Haytham is dispatched to the American Colonies to locate the Temple. While in Boston, he kills a slave trader, freeing a group of Mohawks 
           including a woman named Kaniehti:io, who asks Haytham to refer to her as Ziio after he proves unable to pronounce her full name. 
           She helps Haytham find the Temple in exchange for him killing General Braddock. Haytham and Ziio find that the Key is not able to open 
           the temple itself. The pair develop a romantic relationship during their time together, which results in a son, Ratonhnhaké:ton. 
           The perspective then shifts to Ratonhnhaké:ton's childhood in 1760. His mother dies during an attack on his village which Ratonhnhaké:ton 
           believes was led by the Templar Charles Lee. Years later, the village Elder informs a teenage Ratonhnhaké:ton that their tribe's duty is to 
           prevent the Temple's discovery. The Elder gives him a transparent Sphere which allows Juno to communicate with him; she tells him of his 
           importance and shows him the Assassins' symbol. The symbol leads him to the retired Assassin Achilles Davenport, who reluctantly begins 
           training him as an assassin.</p>

        <p>Achilles suggests Ratonhnhaké:ton rename himself "Connor" to enable him to move more freely throughout the Colonies, in fear that some 
           colonists might reject him as a tribe member. While seeking supplies in Boston, Connor is framed by the Templars for instigating the Boston 
           Massacre. Over the following years, Connor kills several Templars, and aids in the Revolutionary War between the Patriots and the British. 
           Connor meets with his father, and the two forge a temporary alliance to eliminate a rogue Templar. Later, Haytham uncovers a letter detailing 
           George Washington's plan to remove the Indigenous population, including Connor's tribe, from the frontier to prevent them supporting the 
           Loyalists. Connor returns to his village and learns that Lee has recruited several Mohawk warriors to turn back the Patriots sent to eradicate 
           them. Connor neutralizes the warriors to avoid conflict, but his childhood friend Kanen'tó:kon cannot be reasoned with and Connor is forced to 
           kill him.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Desmond is occasionally roused from the Animus to retrieve power cells from Manhattan and Brazil, necessary for activating the Temple,
           before the Templar Daniel Cross can take them. William goes after the final cell himself, but is captured by the Templars' modern day front, 
           Abstergo. Desmond assaults the facility, kills Cross and Warren Vidic, and rescues his father.</p>

        <p>Connor becomes conflicted about eliminating the Templars, and hopes to work with Haytham towards a common vision of peace and freedom. 
           However, Haytham remains convinced of the chaos of freedom and the necessity to control the nation by replacing Washington with Lee. 
           Lee is disgraced by Washington for attempting to sabotage the outcome of the Battle of Monmouth and takes refuge in the heavily fortified Fort 
           George. Connor infiltrates the fort and is confronted by Haytham; they duel, and Connor kills him. Connor later kills Lee and recovers the Key. 
           With the Colonial Templars eliminated, Connor returns to his village only to find it empty, and the Sphere left behind. Using it, 
           Juno instructs him to conceal the Key where it cannot be found; Connor buries the Key in the grave of Achilles' son, Connor Davenport.</p>

        <p>In 2012, Desmond retrieves the Key and accesses the Temple's inner chambers. Juno informs him that activating the pedestal will save the world, 
           but at the cost of his life. Minerva appears before them, opposing the plan as it will free Juno, who was sealed away in the temple to prevent 
           her conquering humanity. Juno and Minerva explain that if the solar flare occurs, Desmond will be one of the few survivors in a 
           post-apocalyptic world. After Desmond's later death, he will become revered as a god, whose well-intended legacy will be manipulated to 
           control future generations, restarting the cycle. Desmond chooses to sacrifice himself in order to save humanity and give them the opportunity 
           to fight Juno rather than be destroyed. William, Shaun, and Rebecca leave the temple as Desmond activates the pedestal; a global aurora protects 
           the planet from the solar eruption. Juno commends Desmond's choice and declares that it is time for her part to begin.</p>

        <p>In an epilogue, Connor takes down the Templar portraits in the Davenport Manor's basement and burns them, signifying the end of his journey. 
           In addition, his return to his village is detailed further, showing he spoke to a hunter there, who revealed that the land had been sold to 
           settlers in order to settle the new United States government's war debts. Connor also travels to the pier in New York, where he witnesses the 
           last of the British Regulars leave America for good. However, he also sees evidence of the slave trade present in the newly formed nation, 
           right next to the pier of citizens cheering at the departure of the British, learning that not all people have been freed.</p>

        <p>Following this, a modern-day voiceover can be heard directing the listener to locate a number of 'pivot points' that have been spread out 
           across the memories' graphical representation of Colonial America. Once collected, the voiceover returns to congratulate, and informs that 
           they have now connected to the cloud.</p>

        <h1>Development</h1>

    <section class="bred">

        <h2>Origins</h2>

        <p>Work on Assassin's Creed III began in January 2010 
           (almost immediately after the release of Assassin's Creed II) by a senior team of Ubisoft developers. 
           The title was in development for two and a half years and had the longest development cycle since the first Assassin's Creed. 
           When Ubisoft first revealed Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood in 2010, as new details came to light, there was some confusion within the gaming 
           community as to whether this would be Assassin's Creed III. According to the developers, Brotherhood was not Assassin's Creed III, 
           and the third installment would not star a "pre-existing character." Ubisoft Montreal's developers stated in their interviews that Assassin's 
           Creed III would be released eventually.</p>

        <p>Jean-François Boivin of Ubisoft also stated that each numbered title in the series will introduce a new lead character and a new setting. 
           Patrice Désilets, former series' creative director, said that the series has always been planned as a trilogy.
           He also commented on the story of Assassin's Creed III, saying that it would focus on Assassins' quest to prevent the end of the world in 2012,
           and their race against time to find temples and Apples of Eden built by "Those Who Came Before". Desmond would be searching for clues as to the
           locations of these temples, by exploring memories of one (or more) of his other ancestors.</p>

        <p>In October 2011 Alexandre Amacio, creative director of Assassin's Creed: Revelations, announced that the next installment of the franchise was 
           to be released before December 2012, however, Amacio himself would not be directing the game. This comes from the idea that Desmond Miles, 
           the modern day protagonist of the series, was to finish his tale by December 2012. Amacio said that gamers should not have to play a futuristic 
           game after the time period in which it is set.</p>

        <h2>Pre-announcement</h2>

        <p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed during an earnings call on November 8, 2011, that a new "major" Assassin's Creed game would be released in 
           2012. Guillemot refused to go into any further detail on the title beyond its confirmation.Speaking to MCV, Guillemot dismissed the notion 
           that annual Assassin's Creed installments are diluting the brands, stating instead that they're necessary to "satisfy the demand". 
           Guillemot also claimed in the same interview that this year's Assassin's Creed will be the series' "biggest to date."</p>

        <p>In February 2012, Ubisoft officially confirmed the existence of Assassin's Creed III, and its North American release date of October 30, 2012. 
           Guillemot described Assassin's Creed III as "the true next generation of both the Assassin's Creed brand and interactive 
           entertainment/storytelling in general. We will push the title a lot because it's a fantastic product that the team has been working on for 
           three years. What we have seen is just fabulous." Guillemot went on to say the publisher's investing more heavily in the game than in any other 
           title in the series.</p>

        <h2>Internal leaks</h2>

        <p>Reports that Assassin's Creed III would take place during the American Revolution surfaced following a supposed "inside source" at Ubisoft, 
           who made such a claim in January 2012. On February 29, 2012, an upcoming promotional image of the game was sent to Kotaku by a Best Buy employee,
           along with information from the retailer that a full reveal was imminent. The leaked promotional image led to a general consensus that the game 
           was set in North America during the American Revolution, and at least in part, a snowy setting. Around the same time, 
           Ubisoft mentioned "a major announcement from Assassin's Creed" was "only days away" via the series' official Facebook. 
           The page's cover photo also depicted a snowy and bleak setting.[28] Furthermore, Game Informer appeared ready to confirm the fresh details 
           via an advertising banner posted on its site. Images showed the new assassin standing next to American revolutionary leader George Washington.</p>

        <p>Following the reports, Ubisoft released Assassin's Creed III's official box art on March 1, 2012, which confirmed the game's American Revolution 
           setting. The company said it will announce "all the details" at 5pm on March 5. Additionally, Game Informer revealed its latest cover feature, 
           which included more artwork of the game's new main character.[31] On March 2, several screenshots were leaked ahead of Ubisoft's official reveal,
           and the first gameplay details emerged via Game Informer.</p>

        <h2>Post-announcement</h2>

        <p>Assassin's Creed III was unveiled with a cinematic trailer on March 5, 2012. Ubisoft described the game as the "most ambitious" project in 
           the company's history, with twice the production capacity of any previous title from the publisher. The game's engine, AnvilNext, delivers 
           improved visuals, character models and AI, allowing for battlefields full of fighters. Ubisoft later said it's aiming to make 
           Assassin's Creed III "look next-gen" on current-gen consoles using the new AnvilNext engine.</p>

        <p>Ubisoft said that when Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption released midway through Assassin's Creed III's development, it was surprised to see 
           Rockstar had included wild animal hunting and a giant frontier to explore—features both planned for its own sequel. Lead writer Corey May 
           said Ubisoft's now looking at Red Dead's success and trying to take the formula in "new directions". Similarities between these two games 
           are down to "a convergence of minds", said Assassin's Creed III writer Matt Turner.[34] Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said Ubisoft steered 
           clear of making the Assassin's Creed III protagonist a female character because the game's setting is not a strong match. 
           Hutchinson said while many people wanted to see female assassins in the series, the American Revolution setting makes it difficult this time 
           round.</p>

        <p>Ubisoft recommends the PC version of the game to be played with a controller even though it will still support keyboard and mouse setup. 
           Ubisoft Montreal's creative director Alex Hutchinson admitted: "We're definitely supporting PC, we love PC, but I think it'll be PC with 
           a controller. I don't see us investing hugely in a mouse and keyboard setup. I think if you want to play on PC and you want to play 
           Assassin's Creed, you have a controller."</p>
