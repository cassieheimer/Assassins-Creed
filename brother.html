        <h1>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</h1>

    <section class="bred">

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>

        <p>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is an action-adventure video game with main emphasis on nonlinear, 
           sandbox style gameplay, parkour movements, crowd-blending stealth, assassinations and melee fighting system. 
           The combat system features several improvements and for the first time in the series, 
           the game offers a multiplayer mode alongside 15+ hours of single-player gameplay.</p>

        <p>The game introduces a new management system: the player can recruit new members by destroying any of twelve "Borgia towers" 
           around Rome where papal troops are stationed and then rescuing disgruntled citizens in their districts from being harassed by guards. 
           The player, as Ezio, can then send them to assignments around Europe or call them for support during missions (if they are not already occupied).
           Tasking the novice Assassins makes them gain experience, and the player is able to customize their appearance, 
           skills, and weapon training to some degree by spending the skill points they have earned. Assassins can die on missions, 
           from which they will not return. Ezio masters new gadgets, such as Leonardo da Vinci's parachute, 
           which can be used when jumping from tall buildings, along with poison darts, a faster acting poison, a crossbow, 
           and the ability to hold and throw heavier weapons like axes.</p>

        <p>The primary setting is Rome, which has fallen into ruin due to the corrupt rule of the Borgia papacy and the Templars over the Papal States 
           and concentrating all the wealth in the Vatican. Just like the town of Monteriggioni in Assassin's Creed II, 
           the player is able to invest in the city, witness its development, and unlock rewards. 
           The player has to conquer and destroy Borgia towers to free city zones from the family's influence.
           Completing this unlocks new missions and opportunities. Rome is larger than any of the cities in the first two installments 
           (Rome is three times bigger than Florence from Assassin's Creed II) and includes five districts: Vatican (Vaticano), Central (Centro), 
           Trans-Tiber (Trastevere), Country (Campagna) and Antique (Antico). Unlike the previous installments, 
           travel between different cities or regions is no longer present, as most of the action in the game takes place around the city of Rome. 
           Instead, a series of tunnel networks throughout the city allow the player to travel to different sectors of the city with ease. 
           However players will be able to explore the entire city of Rome, visit the harbour of Naples, a part of Navarre, Spain, Valnerina, 
           Lake of Nevi and present day Monteriggioni.</p>

        <p>The combat system has been modified. Striking first and offensive actions are more deadly in Brotherhood than previous games where 
           counter-attacks were the most efficient. Before, this made the player wait until the AI struck, which slowed down the pace of fighting. 
           The AI in this game is thus more aggressive and enemies can attack simultaneously. 
           To dispatch them, Ezio can use melee and ranged weapons at the same time, as well as introducing the hidden pistol in combat. 
           After killing one enemy the player can start an execution streak to dispatch multiple enemies quickly. 
           Ezio can throw heavy weapons (axes, spears, and swords) at his enemies. 
           There are new enemy archetypes in addition to those seen in Assassin's Creed II such as horsemen, arquebusiers, papal guards and others.</p>

        <p>Horses play a larger role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of transport 
           (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, 
           allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Brotherhood also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, 
           featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower pot in Assassin's Creed II to move faster 
           inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly 
           climb up high buildings or structures.</p>

        <p>Unlike previous installments, Desmond can leave the Animus at almost any time. 
           This allows Desmond to explore the present-day town of Monteriggioni. The player is also offered virtual training, 
           a mini-game where the player may test their free-running or combat skills.</p>

        <h2>Multiplayer</h2>

        <p>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood is the first game in the main series to feature a multiplayer mode. 
           The players are Templars in training at the Abstergo facility. They use the animi (plural for animus) seen at the beginning of 
           Assassin's Creed II to access memories of old Templars and to acquire their skills using the "bleeding effect". 
           There are eight game modes (Wanted, Alliance, Manhunt, Chest Capture, Advanced Wanted, Advanced Alliance, Escort and Assassinate) 
           and different maps, including the areas from the second and the third game like Florence, as well as new maps like Rome, Castel Gandolfo, 
           Siena and Mont Saint-Michel. The gameplay in multiplayer mode is similar to the core gameplay of the series, 
           as players are required to use their assassination and stealth skills. The players must hunt down targets while being hunted themselves. 
           Players earn points by performing assassinations, defending against pursuers, attaining bonuses or completing mode-specific objectives. 
           It also contains a variety of characters, most of which must be unlocked.</p>

        <p>The multiplayer mode also includes a leveling system, which allows players to unlock rewards by earning experience points during 
           the matches and gaining new levels. Players can then unlock abilities, perks and streaks. 
           Abilities are active skills, which can be used again only after a cool down time. Perks are passive skills, 
           which can be equipped before the match and they are active all the time. Streaks are bonuses awarded for reaching certain number of successful 
           or failed contracts. The multiplayer beta, exclusive to PlayStation 3 users, was announced at E3 2010. 
           It began on October 4, 2010, with early access for PlayStation Plus subscribers from September 27, and ended on October 18, 2010. 
           Three maps were playable in the beta: Rome, Castel Gandolfo and Siena.</p>

        <h1>Game modes</h1>

    <section class="bred">

        <h2>Free-For-All</h2>

        <p>In Wanted, at least six players are on a map where they must find and assassinate each other. Each player is given another player as a target. 
           The goal is to find and kill a target without being seen or killed by the player's own pursuer or pursuers. 
           Players are indistinguishable from some of the NPC's throughout the maps. If the player kills an NPC by mistake or otherwise breaks cover, 
           they are more easily spotted by pursuer or target alike, sometimes resulting in a chase. 
           The player with the highest score at the end of the session wins. Players will lose their contract if they kill an NPC, 
           are stunned by their target or their target is killed by another player. A player cannot kill another player who is not the target, 
           but they can stun their hunter. Advanced Wanted mode is a variant of Wanted mode, with differences between malakas and skilas includes an 
           increased amount of NPCs on the map to make it difficult to pick out targets and a less accurate compass. 
           There is generally more stealth involved in this mode than in basic Wanted.</p>

        <p>The Assassinate mode is similar to Wanted, but instead of target contracts being assigned to players, all players are fair game. 
           Players must identify other player characters and lock on before assassinating. Because two players can kill each other, 
           whoever locks on first becomes the hunter and the other becomes the target. The standard compass found in Wanted is replaced by directional 
           arrows based on proximity, that grow to become arcs around the perimeter of the compass as other players near, 
           and will eventually create a full circle when other players are very close. As in other modes, the player with the highest score 
           at the end of the session is the winner.</p>
       
        <h2>Team</h2>

        <p>In Alliance, there are three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona. 
           The point of this mode is to get more points than the other teams, but each team is chased by another and is only allowed to kill one 
           specific team (not the team chasing them, but they will be able to stun the team hunting them). This mode encourages players to work together, 
           as teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously. 
           The Advanced Alliance mode is a variant of Alliance mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, 
           similar to the Advanced Wanted mode.</p>

        <p>In Manhunt there are two teams of four. One team is the hunters, the other is the hunted. 
           Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. 
           Hunters obtain points by assassinations, while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and remaining hidden. 
           The team with the highest score wins. In Chest Capture there are two teams of four. One team is the hunters, 
           and the other is the hunted who need to steal chests by standing close to them. 
           Each team looks like a specific character and takes turns being the hunter and the hunted. Hunters obtain points by assassinations, 
           while the hunted obtain points from escapes, stuns, and stealing chests. The team with the highest score wins. 
           The Escort mode sees one team of four players protecting a wandering NPC while the other team of four tries to assassinate him. 
           There are two NPCs to protect at a time and they walk through a series of checkpoints, which are visible to both teams. 
           When an escorted NPC is killed, another is synchronized. This mode has two rounds with each team playing once as an escort and once as assassins.</p>

        <h2>Characters</h2>

        <p>Players are able to choose one of the 21 available characters, including: Courtesan, Barber, Priest, Noble, Prowler, Executioner, Doctor, 
           Blacksmith, Captain, Smuggler, Engineer,[11][12] Footpad,[13][14] Thief, Hellequin (a female Harlequin, which is available through uPlay) 
           and Mercenary. Two special characters were only available in the selected pre-order editions of the game: the Harlequin and the Officer. 
           However, these two pre-order special characters are also included in The Da Vinci Disappearance downloadable content as are the formerly 
           pre-order only Trajan Market and Aqueducts special locations. The pack contains 4 new characters, Dama Rossa, Knight, Marquis, and Pariah. 
           Each character has unique assassination moves and a signature weapon.[15] Characters can be customized as the player levels up. 
           These customization options include changing the color of the outfit, and equipping different gear.</p>

        <h1>Synopsis</h1>

    <section class="bred">

        <h2>Plot</h2>

        <p>Desmond's story continues where it left off, in 2012. After escaping the Templars' attack at the end of Assassin's Creed II, 
           Desmond Miles, Lucy Stillman, Rebecca Crane, and Shaun Hastings flee to Monteriggioni, establishing a new hideout in the ruins of the 
           Villa Auditore. After restoring the electricity in the old tunnels under the villa, the player once again takes control of Ezio Auditore 
           through Desmond's genetic memory, using the Animus 2.0 (which is the game's memory interface). Their mission is to find the Apple of Eden, 
           an important and mysterious artifact that could prevent the impending disaster that is coming in that same year, believed to be perpetrated 
           by the Templars.</p>

        <p>Ezio's story continues in 1499, where he exits the Vault, confused by what he saw inside. He escapes Rome with his uncle, Mario Auditore, 
           and returns to Monteriggioni. Once home, Ezio is comforted by the prospect that his personal vendetta is over; however, Niccolò Machiavelli 
           challenges Ezio's decision to leave Rodrigo Borgia (now Pope Alexander VI) alive. The following morning - New Year’s Day -
            Monteriggioni is besieged by Cesare Borgia, son of Rodrigo. Mario is killed at the hands of Cesare himself, and the Apple lost to Cesare 
           and the Templars. Ezio escapes with his family and travels once more to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, once again seeking 
           vengeance against the Borgias. There, he discovers that the Assassins are failing in their fight against corruption. Determined to rebuild 
           the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he has what it takes to lead while assembling a Brotherhood powerful enough to destroy the Templars 
           and his new nemesis, Cesare.</p>

        <p>Over the next four years, Ezio executes various tasks meant to cripple the Borgias' hold in the capital, 
           sabotaging Cesare's resources and assassinating key people close to and/or working with him in the process, and slowly restoring Rome to 
           its former glory. After returning the Roman Assassins to full strength, Ezio is given the rank of Il Mentore (Italian for "The Mentor"), 
           and made de facto leader of the Assassins in Italy. During this time, Ezio's sister Claudia is also made an Assassin.</p>

        <p>Cesare, learning of Ezio's actions, confronts his suspicious father and desperately asks for more money, and the Apple itself. 
           Rodrigo refuses, cautious of provoking the Assassins, and attempts to poison his son, realizing that Cesare's lust for power can't be held 
           at bay. Cesare, however, turns the tables on his father and kills him instead. Ezio witnesses this and, after learning of the Apple's location, 
           retrieves it from within St. Peter's Basilica. Ezio uses it to overwhelm Cesare's forces and gradually withdraw the backing of his supporters; 
           Cesare is finally arrested by Pope Julius II's Papal Army after Ezio and the Assassins confront him and kill his remaining followers.</p>

        <p>Sometime later, Ezio uses the Apple once more to check on Cesare, who has broken out of prison and, after gaining the support of his new patron,
           John III of Navarre, laid siege to the city of Viana, in Navarre. Ezio encounters Cesare on the battlements of a crumbling castle and fights him.
           Cesare claims that he cannot be killed by the hand of a mortal man, thus inciting Ezio to "leave [him] in the hands of fate" by dropping him off 
           the battlements to his death. Ezio then takes the Apple and hides it in a First Civilization Temple built underneath Roman Colosseum.</p>

        <p>Using the coordinates taken from Ezio's memories, Desmond, Lucy, Shaun and Rebecca travel to the Temple, intending to use the Apple to locate 
           the remaining Temples and keep the other Pieces of Eden out of the Templars' hands. As Desmond makes his way into the Temple, he is confronted 
           with holographic apparitions of a being called Juno, who appears to be of the same race as Minerva; however, she is neither audible nor visible 
           to Lucy, Shaun, or Rebecca. Most of her comments center on humanity's lack of knowledge. She states that humanity is "innocent and ignorant;" 
           that people were not built to be wise, having been given only five of the six senses: sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, but lacking 
           knowledge. Her careful cadence then drops, as she suddenly becomes angry, yelling, "We should have left you as you were!"</p>

        <p>As Desmond approaches the Apple and touches it, time freezes around him, though he can still move and speak. 
           Juno cryptically states that Desmond is descended from her race, and is their enemy; she also says there is a woman who would accompany 
           him through "the gate," but must not be allowed to. She takes control of Desmond's body and forces him to stab Lucy in the abdomen. 
           Both fall to the ground, with Lucy dead and Desmond entering a coma. As the credits roll, two men are heard discussing whether to put 
           Desmond back in the Animus.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>

        <p>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was developed by Ubisoft Montreal. Montreal also worked on both of the other main Assassin's Creed games 
           in the series and was thus chosen to lead production for the third installment. A new Assassin's Creed episode featuring multiplayer was 
           announced during Ubisoft's 2009 fiscal third quarter results while not revealing its name. In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published 
           on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on 
           Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity of these pictures.[16] Brotherhood has not been numbered unlike 
           Assassin's Creed II because players, and even developers themselves would have expected a new setting and a new ancestor while this is 
           only the continuation of Ezio's story.</p>

        <p>The game was developed primarily by Ubisoft Montreal in Canada. Production was aided in part by four other Ubisoft developers: Annecy, 
           Singapore, Bucharest and Québec City. The multiplayer mode is mainly developed by Ubisoft Annecy, the studio responsible for creating 
           multiplayer mode in Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. Ubisoft also announced plans for downloadable content (DLC) after the game's launch.
           Two sets of free DLC have already been released under the names "Animus Project Update 1.0" and "Animus Project Update 2.0". 
           The first includes the new map Mont Saint-Michel and one new mode, Advanced Alliance. The "Animus Project Update 2.0" was released in January 
           2011, was also free, and included another map, mode and the introduction of a player grading system. 
           From the perspective of performance, Ubisoft have commented that they hope the gaps between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions 
           will be even smaller with Brotherhood.</p>

        <p>Additionally, humorist Danny Wallace and actress Kristen Bell reprise their roles from Assassin's Creed II.</p>

        <p>While still in development, creative director Patrice Désilets left before the game's presentation at the E3 2010. 
           Ubisoft and production manager Jean-Francois Boivin stated that he only took a "creative break" after completing his task on Brotherhood. 
           A teaser trailer of the multiplayer mode was released on the official site before the E3. A cinematic debut trailer was diffused during 
           Ubisoft's E3 2010 press conference along a walkthrough of the game's beginning. Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood reached gold status on October 28, 
           2010. The Microsoft Windows version has Nvidia 3D Vision and multi screen support through AMD Eyefinity. It also uses Tagès copy protection, 
           as well as Ubisoft online services platform, but doesn't require an always-on Internet connection to play. On November 30, 2010, 
           a novelization of the game was published. The novel is a sequel to the previous novel.</p>
